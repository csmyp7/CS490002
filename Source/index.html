<div>
<h> This div object has a header, an unordered list, and a paragraph </h>
<ul>
<li> who cares</li>
<li>  if these lines </li>
<li> are in order? </li>
</ul>
<p> This is a paragraph. It has more than one sentence. </p>
</div>

<div>
<h> This is another header, for a completely different div object </h>
<ol>
<li> These lines are in order. </li>
<li> I hope. </li>
</div>

<span>
<h> These are inline objects, if this works. </h>

<p> I hope you enjoyed this span object. It had several inline elements. </p>
</span>

<span>
<h> Look! We created another span object! </h>
<p> We're really not sure what else to include here. Let's check the project requirements (referenced above) and see what else we need. </p>
<span> I really hate inline elements that mess with the spacing of a web page. What is this, 2001? </span>
